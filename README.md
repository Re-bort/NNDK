NNDK
====

The Neural Network Development Kit (NNDK) is a C++ template-based class library that implements a range of supervised and unsupervised artificial neural network classes, training algorithms; and auxiliary classes that implement algorithms for data splitting and variable selection.

The Neural Network Development Kit was developed as part of research undertaken by the School of Civil, Environmental and Mining Engineering at the University of Adelaide, with a goal to develop best-practices for the application of neural networks to water resources and environmental modelling applications.

The aim was to develop a class library to implement fundamental ANN structures and learning algorithms, which could be used to rapidly develop and evaluate new model development procedures.

An Excel add-in that provides a GUI for a pre-compiled set of tools for the development of ANN models for time-series forecasting and non-linear regression applications, was implemented using on the NNDK.
